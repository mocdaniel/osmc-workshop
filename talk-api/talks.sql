'Are all those metrics you collect actually earning their keep? And what about alert rules—how many are silently broken, doomed never to fire? Monitoring nowadays is efficient enough to store billions of unique time series. But do all the series you store actually “pay the rent”? In this talk, Roman shows how to hunt down “ghost” metrics and “silent” alerts using the VictoriaMetrics ecosystem. You''ll learn:\n- How to spot time-series that no one has queried in months\n-Hints to find alerting rules that can never trigger\n-A repeatable workflow for pruning data without risking blind spots\n\nTrim the noise, shrink your storage footprint, and reclaim performance—because the cheapest metric is the one you never write.', 1, FALSE, '2025-11-19 08:30:00+01', '2025-11-19 09:15:00+01'),

'Memory and CPU constrained sensor nodes (we are often talking about a few MHz and few dozen kB RAM) are challenging to add in a classic infrastructure monitoring system. Since monitoring of environmental health indicators (temperature, humidity, CO2, concentration of other gases) can be crucial for failure free running of an IT infrastructure (or offices where air quality does not kill productivity). However, Zabbix, Icinga and Checkmk all offer some flexibility for collecting data in a wide range of environments. In this talk, I will present you with a few techniques on how to get sensor data into your monitoring. The talk is structured in two parts. Part one will cover the situation where the firmware of embedded devices cannot be modified. In this case, often gateways or brokers have to be queried. You will get a short overview on typical paths your sensor data takes with LoraWAN, NBIoT and MQTT. The second, longer part takes into account the situation where firmware can be modified or completely replaced. This will creatively leverage unique ways of submitting monitoring data to the three aforementioned monitoring systems.', 2, FALSE, '2025-11-19 08:30:00+01', '2025-11-19 09:15:00+01'),

'We all aim for systems that “just work,” but let’s be real: perfect uptime is a myth. The reality is, even the most robust services will encounter hiccups. The trick isn’t to prevent every single error, but to understand what really matters to our users and to manage those expectations effectively. That’s where Service Level Objectives (SLOs) come in. In this talk, we’ll cut through the noise and dive deep into why reliability isn’t just an engineering concern, but a critical business driver. We’ll demystify the core concepts: what are Service Level Indicators (SLIs), how do they feed into our SLOs, and where do Service Level Agreements (SLAs) fit into the picture? Then, we’ll get practical. We’ll walk through the process of setting effective SLOs for your services, from choosing the right metrics (SLIs), to defining your SLO targets – how the concept of error budgets is a game-changer – to how we can respond to SLO and SLI deviations before end-user impact escalates. Join me to learn how the open-source Grafana stack can be your go-to platform for defining, tracking, and acting on your SLOs, transforming your approach to reliability from reactive firefighting to proactive, user-centric excellence.', 3, FALSE, '2025-11-19 09:30:00+01', '2025-11-19 10:00:00+01'),

Intelligent agents can understand your systems, alerts, and workflows, pull context from your observability stack, surface probable causes, and help human responders take the right action faster. From supporting engineers in their daily on-call duties to stepping in during high-stakes outages, AI agents are becoming indispensable teammates, not just nice-to-have features.

(15, 'Easy logging refinement with flowg', 'Logs are an essential part of any monitoring infrastructure. They are the very first thing a system operator or a developer will reach for when debugging past or on going issues. As the infrastructure of your team or organization grows, more and more applications produce logs, in various locations and shape. In our use case, we have multiple clusters, each running multiple virtual machines, each running many containers, and some even have multiple processes running inside. Some logs are structured and formatted using JSON, or logfmt. Some other are unstructured and textual. Some applications integrate with OpenTelemetry, most do not. Solutions has been developed to aggregate and ingest those logs, such as Splunk, Datadog, the Elastic stack, or even OpenObserve, but all of them require careful processing of the logs before sending it to said services. Processing such as categorization (to identify where the log is coming from), refinement (parsing the log to give it more structure or metadata, or remove the unwanted information), filtering (to reduce storage costs), anonymization (to remove sensitive information that must not be persisted). This can be done with tools such as Logstash, but setup is complex, time consuming, and not very flexible. This is where FlowG comes in, and shines. It provides a low code environment with flow-based pipelines and scripts using the Vector Remap Language to easily categorize, refine, filter, anonymize your logs and store them in distinct destinations or forward them to your favorite third party service.

However, current execution tracing system implementations available capture only a subset (only 1-5 %) of traces to manage storage and scale constraints effectively. The distribution of randomly sampled set is heavily skewed towards the normal/consistent execution-traces, missing out on unusual/interesting execution-traces required for the purposes of effective diagnosis of API-failures and Performance issues in the application and thus affecting both the Developers and SRE teams. We proposed a solution based on Machine Learning and Cognitive approach to remove this bias in collection of traces and storage and use self-adaptive method that can dynamically adapt based on actual data. The system can self-learn to capture the traces that are of higher interest (more variations in errors, warnings, response-codes etc.) and which can add value in finding the actual root cause of an issues, while maintaining the distribution ratio intact.
